# PiVision

This was written for the 2017 FRC challenge FIRST Steamworks. This code calculates the deviation of the vision target is from the center of the frame. This information is sent to the robot via NetworkTables (a library specific to FRC).

## Usage

The camera will need to be placed in the center of the robot. 

The Pi is hooked into the robot's network using an ethernet connection into the extra port on the router. If you aren't worried about following competition rules, you can connect the Pi with WiFi.
